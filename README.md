# ENYE: A FILIPINO-BASED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
ENYE is a Filipino-based Programming Language that takes inspiration from both Java and C languages.

## LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION
Written in C language, ENYE will make use of hybrid interpretation that caters to a compromise between compilers and pure interpreters, making easy interpretation possible on ENYE. It utilizes commonly used Filipino words as a way for young aspiring Filipino programmers to grasp core concepts in programming. Over time, this allows them to logically use the programming language to solve programming problems.

ENYE is quite easy to understand considering that the choice of keywords matches our everyday use of the said keywords. It is also easier because of the child’s familiarity with the language, hence, can allow young programmers to practice writing basic programs. 

## PHILOSOPHY
ENYE’s core philosophy is to allow aspiring Filipino programmers to code in the comfort of their own language. It will help them have a better understanding and learn the logic and syntax of programming without the difficulty of having to learn a new language.
